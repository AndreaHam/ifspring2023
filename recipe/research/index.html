            <h1>Korean Potato Cheese Corn Dog</h1>
            <h3>Description: Korean corn dogs, also known as gamja hot dogs are a beloved savory, sweet street food found across Korea. They're made with cheese-wrapped hot dogs, rice cakes, or fish cakes, dipped into a yeasted batter, rolled in potatoes and panko, then deep-fried. The fried corn dogs are sprinkled with sugar and then drizzled with sauces such as ketchup, mayo, or mustard.

            <h3>ingredients (12 servings)</h3>
            <p>canola oil, for frying</p>
            <p>
                Potatoes: kosher salt, for boiling. Peeled and cut into 1/4 in (6mm)
            </p>
            <p>
                Batter:
                2 cups all purpose flour,
                3 tablespoons granulated sugar,
                1 tablespoon baking powder,
                ½ teaspoon kosher salt,
                1 cup whole milk, plus 3 tablespoons,
                1 large beaten egg
            </p>
            <p>
                Assembly:
                6 all-beef hot dogs,
                2 shredded low moisture mozzarella cheeses,
                2 cups panko breadcrumbs,
                2 cups korean rice puffs,
                ¼ cup granulated sugar (for sprinkling)
            </p>
            <p>
                Sauce:
                Ketchup, yellow mustard
            </p>
            <p>
                Special equipment: wooden skewers
            </p>
        </div>
       <div class="instructions">
        Fill a large stock pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer with canola oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C). Reduce the heat to medium to maintain the temperature. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet and place it nearby.<br>
            <p>1. Prepare the potatoes: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes and blanch for 2 minutes, then drain and transfer to a medium bowl. Let cool to room temperature, 15–20 minutes. Once cooled, sprinkle the flour over the potatoes and toss until well coated, shaking off and discarding any excess. </p>
            <p>the batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, whisk together 1 cup of milk and the egg until well combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. The batter should be fairly thick; if it is too thick to whisk, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Transfer the batter to a pint glass or another tall, narrow container. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p> 
            <p>3.Thread each hot dog half onto the pointy end of a skewer, cut-side up, pushing down to about 2 inches below the tip. Thread the mozzarella rectangles onto the skewers above the hot dogs so they are flush with the cut ends of the hot dogs and the tips of the skewers.</p>
           <p>4.Add the panko, floured potatoes, and rice puffs to individual plates or small trays.<br>
            5.Working one at a time, dip a cheese and hot dog skewer into the cup with the batter, coating completely. Gently shake off any excess batter.</p> 
           <p> 6.For the original dogs: Roll a battered dog in the panko bread crumbs until well coated, using your fingers to pack on the bread crumbs as needed.</p>
            <p>7.For the potato dogs: Roll a battered dog in the floured potatoes, using your hands to pack on the potatoes to ensure they stick. Immediately roll the potato-coated dog in the panko bread crumbs until completely coated.</p>
           <p> 8.For the crispy rice dogs: Roll a battered dog in rice puffs until completely coated, using your fingers to pack on the puffs as needed.</p>
            <p>9.Place the coated dogs in the hot oil, 2-3 at a time, and fry for 2-3 minutes, until golden brown and crispy, using tongs to turn as needed. Transfer to the wire rack and sprinkle all over with sugar (use tongs when turning; the sticks will be very hot). Repeat with the remaining corn dogs to make 4 of each kind.</p>
            <p>10.To serve, drizzle ketchup and mustard over the corn dogs. Enjoy!</p>

            I like how the recipe and ingredients are easily viewed by aligning them left and right. You can also easily share or print the recipe (and even watch a how to make video). The fine details make the website appealing, such as cooking time, amount per servings, and a link to shop ingredients online.

            The soft, geometric font gives a friendly recipe website feeling. I like how important texts are in bold and boxed like an icon. The website also kindly explains tips, detailed explanation about the food, and comparisons (Korean corn dogs vs. American corn dogs).

            There’s a “save to my recipe” and “jump to recipe” button, which is very unique and well-designed. The different uses in fonts are well-organized and rather make the recipe viewed easier. Explains the recipe in several methods: stove pot method and instant pot method.

            Very unique and interesting opening of the website and way to communicate with the users. The tarot card animation really grabbed my eye. Although the overall website might seem simple with colors and techniques, I think it rather matches well with the pencil-sketched style of the tarot cards and its deliveries.

            I like how each section is categorized by round boxes that slightly expand when you put the cursor. The overall use of soft colors and gradient describes his works and personality very well.

            Very calming and simple design that matches with their quiet cafe vibes. The cursor enlarges at the vertical category bar, where each category is briefly explained on the right with a relevant video/image on the left.
