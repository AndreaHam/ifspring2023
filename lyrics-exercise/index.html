        <p>Tell me everything and hold no lies<br>
            Say you're waiting for better skies<br>
            When you're mad as hell and you realize<br>
            All the little things which we rely<br>

            Hoping, praying<br>
            Working every day to get my mind right<br>

            Where were you when I was lost<br>
            So far from trying<br>

            Stick around now, I miss you every night<br>
            We could pass time moving left and right<br>
            Think about when life goes by<br>
